# Navigation

The Navigation component has three main parts:

- **NavController**: Responsible for navigating between destinations—that is, the screens in your app.
- **NavGraph**: Maps composable destinations to navigate to.
  - Route 對應關係
- **NavHost**: Composable acting as a container for displaying the current destination of the NavGraph.
  - 根據 Route 顯示畫面
